# Fair Data Society Registry

The code in this repo allows to maintain a file in a [FairOS](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairOS-dfs) decentralized storage, that is used to generate a static page with a browsable list of items.

Specifically, the items being references to data stored in decentralized storage.

## Liberate Data Directory example

An example of a Directory generated by the process is the Liberate Data Directory located at: [https://directory.fairdatasociety.org/](https://directory.fairdatasociety.org/)

The FairOS reference of the pod is `5bb2cd9d685a7d98866eb00782a29ec9e8d0384210b455497c29382e85493edc`.

You can view the file content with site above or manually by receiving all actual content with FairOS
command

`pod receive 5bb2cd9d685a7d98866eb00782a29ec9e8d0384210b455497c29382e85493edc`

## How to contribute to Liberate Data Directory?

Currently, the following decentralized storages are supported:
- [Swarm](https://www.ethswarm.org/)
- [FairOS-dfs](https://docs.fairos.fairdatasociety.org/docs/)

If you know of a public dataset stored in decentralized storage listed above, you can:
- fork this repo
- edit the file `/cmd/files.json` according to the structure provided below
- issue a pull request

An editor will review the pull request and process it.

## How does it works?

A FairOS user is run by an organization. This user creates a FairOS pod and puts files.json inside it. The file contains a list
of references to files / data from other providers. All of these files are stored in Swarm using FairOS. Knowing the reference file, any user can download it to their computer.


## Registry management
